# terrain-editor
Terrain Editor project for Nebula Trifid Game Engine

Features:
* Brushes implemented as alpha pictures which can be easily added to editor.
* Easy pipeline for adding new types(function) of brushes like standard, smooth or flat.
* Tileable multi-texturing implemented as splat-maps.
* Very natural way of painting textures thanks to implemented additional blending with on-the-fly normalization instead of typical linear interpolation.
